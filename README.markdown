Windows XP Snap
---------------

An AutoIt script that allows you to snap windows to the left/right half of the screen in Windows XP (kinda like Aero snap in Windows 7).

Running the Snap App
--------------------

Run the script using [AutoIt](http://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/) from the command line:

    AutoIt3.exe win_xp_snap_app.au3

Alternatively, check out the Downloads button above where you can download the an EXE compiled with Aut2exe and which uses an awesome icon by [Yusuke Kamiyamane](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/): [https://github.com/downloads/kitmenke/WinXPSnapApp/WinXPSnapApp.zip](https://github.com/downloads/kitmenke/WinXPSnapApp/WinXPSnapApp.zip)

Usage
-----

By default, the app sets your hotkeys to the following:

 - CTRL+ALT+RIGHT - snap current window to the right half of the screen
 - CTRL+ALT+LEFT  - snap current window to the left half of the screen

You can also use the tray icon to snap windows left or right.
