Windows XP Snap
---------------

An AutoIt script that allows you to snap windows to the left/right half of the screen in Windows XP (think Aero snap in Windows 7 except using hotkeys).

Running the Snap App
--------------------

Run the script using [AutoIt](http://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/) from the command line:

    AutoIt3.exe win_xp_snap_app.au3

Alternatively, you can download an EXE compiled with Aut2exe and which uses an awesome icon by [Yusuke Kamiyamane](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/).

Usage
-----

By default, the app sets your hotkeys to the following:

 - CTRL+ALT+RIGHT - snap current window to the right half of the screen
 - CTRL+ALT+LEFT  - snap current window to the left half of the screen

You can also use the tray icon to snap windows left or right. Or, use the custom snap option which allows you to resize a window to specific dimensions.
